# Data Science Course
My work on the Data Science Mini-Degree by Zenva Academy

[2 - Learn Python Programming by Making a Game](https://andoeme.github.io/datascience/2_learn_python_programming_by_making_a_game.py)
This chapter teaches basic concepts of Python. A nice refresher to me were tuples, lists and dictionaries. 
**The final project is a game using PyGame. I haven't finished that one yet, but will upload it in the future.**

[3 - Numpy Matrices and Vectors](https://andoeme.github.io/datascience/3_numpy_matrices_and_vectors.py)
Learning about matrices in this course was interesting. Matrices aren't complex, but I learnt something new here: how to multiply them.

[4 - Web Scraping with Python and BeautifulSoup](https://andoeme.github.io/datascience/4_web_scraping_with_python_and_beautifulsoup.py)
I was excited about the web scraping part. I learnt how to scrape data from a webpage, how to filter the data and write it readable to a file.
I worked with table and non-table data. The table-data was written to a CSV file and I imported it to Excel. It looks great!

**There are 9 more chapters in this couse and I'll upload them as soon as I complete the tasks. I'm looking forward to working with Pandas.**
